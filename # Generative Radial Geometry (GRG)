**GRG** is an original mathematical framework developed by Stefano Ferragina, aiming to define circles and their areas without relying on Ï€ (pi). Instead, it uses internal radial summations, projections, and discrete logic. 

This repository collects:
- Visual explanations
- Formulas derived from radial projections
- Comparisons with classical methods (Archimedes, Leibniz, etc.)
- Downloadable documents (PDFs, images, .docx)

## ðŸ“˜ Key Ideas
- The circle is reconstructed using only the radius and its projections
- The area is calculated by summing vertical heights, not approximated sectors
- The circumference is calculated by angular segmentation (not chords or Ï€)
