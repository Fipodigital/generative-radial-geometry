## 📖 1. Introduction
Generative Radial Geometry (GRG) is a constructive geometric framework developed by Stefano Ferragina to determine the area and circumference of a circle — and more generally of any closed curve — directly from its radius, **without using π**.  
It replaces the continuous, limit-based approach of classical geometry with a **discrete, generative process** based on radial projections.

---

## 📐 2. Core Principles
1. **Radial generation** – Shapes are generated by rotating a radius around a center and recording its projections or chord connections.
2. **Discrete summation** – Area is computed as a sum of radial heights; circumference as a sum of chords at fixed angular steps.
3. **Internal consistency** – The method requires no external constants and converges naturally as resolution increases.

---

## 📊 3. Calculation Methods
### 3.1 Area by Radial Heights
- Divide the base radius into *N* equal segments (Cartesian partition).
- Project the intersection points vertically to form heights.
- Sum all rectangular contributions.

### 3.2 Circumference by Chord Sum
- Divide the full angle (360°) into *N* equal angular steps.
- Compute chord length for each step using the local radius.
- Sum all chords to obtain the total perimeter.

---

## 🔍 4. Comparison with Classical Geometry
- **No π dependency** – GRG derives length/area from measurable radial steps.
- **Same convergence** – Results match classical values as N → ∞, but GRG works without needing to define π.
- **Digital readiness** – Ideal for CAD, CAM, and computational geometry.

---

## 🛠 5. Applications
1. **Circular and elliptical components** – Measuring perimeter and area without approximation constants.
2. **Non-circular closed curves** – Apply a radius variation function r(θ) to generate shapes like ellipses, cam profiles, or lobed contours.
3. **Mechanical parts** – Accurate digital measurement of profiles from simple parametric definitions.

## ⚙ 6. Case Study: Variable-Radius Toothed Sector
A didactic example of GRG applied to a simplified **mechanical toothed sector**:
- **Sector angle**: 120°  
- **Number of teeth**: 12  
- **Base radius**: 50 mm  
- **Addendum/Dedendum**: +4 mm / –2 mm  
- **GRG results**: Perimeter ≈ 279.844 mm, Area ≈ 314.264 mm²
